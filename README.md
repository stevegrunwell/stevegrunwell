# :wave: Hello, there!

I'm Steve, and I love building tools to help people build better software.

By day, I'm a [Staff Software Engineer at Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com), improving the way we handle audience information and our general involvement in the PHP ecosystem.

PHP is my bread-and-butter, and I love building out SaaS and other products using Laravel. I'm also [a WordPress plugin author and core contributor](https://profiles.wordpress.org/stevegrunwell), but my **real** passion is building code quality tools; it shouldn't come as any surprise that I've spent _a lot_ of time working with CI/CD pipelines and all of the tooling that gets run as part of them.

I'm also [a regular conference speaker](https://stevegrunwell.com/speaking) (or at least _was_, pre-pandemic), so you may have met me at any number of PHP, WordPress, or other software-related events.

You can [learn more about me over at stevegrunwell.com](https://stevegrunwell.com), [follow me on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@stevegrunwell), or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stevegrunwell).
